= Variables =
* Variables are by default immutable 
* You can make them mutable
* You can't change the value of an immutable variable

= Constants =
* Constants are always mutable 

= Shadowing =
* In Rust you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous used one.
* let effectively creates a new variable every time
* Something about mutability that I can't wrap my head around

= Data Types =

== Scalar Types ==
Represent a singular value
1. Integet Types: Number without a fractional component
2. Floating-Point Types: Numbers with decimal points 
   * f32: Less precise, slightly faster
   * f64: Default, double precision
3. Boolean Type: 
4. Character Type: Alphabetical type 
   * Uses single quotes, strings use double quotes

== Compound Types ==
1. Tuple Type: Immutable list of values 
   * To get values out of a tuple, you have to invoke a pattern of variables that match it's structure, then call one of them.
2. Array Type: Fixed lengths, unlike in other languages  
   * Stores data on the stack (Tuples store data on the heap)
   * Vector Types: Does grow or shrink in size
   *
